*INHERITANCE - The keyword used for inheritance is `extends`. 

It is the mechanism in java by which one class is allowed to inherit 
the features(fields and methods) of another class. 

Super Class: The class whose features are inherited is known as superclass(or a base class or a parent class).
Sub Class: The class that inherits the other class is known as a subclass(or a derived class, extended class, 
or child class). The subclass can add its own fields and methods in addition to the superclass fields and methods.

1. Single Inheritance:
            subclasses inherit the features of one superclass.
                        A 
                        |
                        B
2. Multilevel Inheritance: 
                     a derived class will be inheriting a base class and 
                     as well as the derived class also act as the base class to other class. 
                        A
                        |
                        B
                        |
                        C
3. Hierarchical Inheritance:                        
     one class serves as a superclass (base class) for more than one subclass.
                        A
                        |
                  ______|_______
                 |      |      |    
                 B      C      D 
4. Multiple Inheritance (Through Interfaces): In Multiple inheritances,
             one class can have more than one superclass and inherit features from all parent classes.                 
    Please NOTE: Java , does not support multiple inheritances with classes.

             A (Interface)       B (Interface)  
              \                 /
               \               /
                 \           /  
                   \       /
                     \   /
                       C (Interface)

5. Hybrid Inheritance(Through Interfaces): 
     Since java doesnâ€™t support multiple inheritances with classes, hybrid inheritance is also not possible with classes.
         In java, we can achieve hybrid inheritance only through Interfaces.                       

                       A 
                    /     \
                  /         \
                /             \
              /                 \
            B (Interface)        C (Interface)  
              \                 /
               \               /
                 \           /  
                   \       /
                     \   /
                       D (Interface)
